# PhotoFinder
Implemented a photo finder primarily using AngularJS (also used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for styling). To use the "Add a new photo" section, please note that you need to copy your JPEG to the 'images' folder, then in the Link section type "images/exampleName.jpg". There is a sample JPEG in the 'images' folder (horse.jpg) to test this.
